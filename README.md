# Swish NYC Basketball Court Finder Web App

### This repository handles the client-side code for the Swish Web App

Swish is a real-time pickup basketball court web app where users can search and choose public basketball courts near them. Once a court is chosen, the user will be able to see or request a status update from other users indicating whether the court is currently too crowded, empty, perfect to get a pickup game in. Users will be able to add a court, designate favorite courts, and view detailed information about every court in NYC.
